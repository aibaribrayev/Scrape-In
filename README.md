# Scrape-In

Chrome extension to find potential customers on LinkedIn. 

A quick introduction video to the extension: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onxL26Xcjt8

The extension allows you to export the data(name, contacts, job information) about all people who have commented / left a reaction to a post on LinkedIn. Thus business owners may find potential customers by selecting posts on LinkedIn related to their product. 

The extension is not currently available on the Chrome Web Store due to the data policies of LinkedIn. 


You may clone and run the program on your computer for now.
